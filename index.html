<h1>Personal Information:</h1>
</div>

<div class="sectionContent">
<p>I was born in Penrith, Australia, I live in Camden NSW. I’m an Australian. I have attended Elderslie High school until 2009 when I graduated from year 12 with a higher school certificate. I then worked and travelled for many years after school until I was ready to continue my studies and pursue a more fulfilling career. I completed my certificate III in digital media and information technology this year and I started a new job as an IT assistant in a high school.  I like to play poker, mountain bike, go to the gym, online game.</p>

<h1>Interest in IT: </h1>
</div>

<div class="sectionContent">
<p>My education in IT has stemmed from a lifelong interest in Computers and technology.  I’ve started my studies in the field of IT because I think it’s an ever growing and important industry that won’t be going away in the future. There was no particular event or person that sparked my interest in IT. I was always playing computer games as a child and was always interested in using the computer when there was still only dial up 56k modems. I always had technology around me my whole life and I think it was just a natural thing that I became interested in learning more, which I think would be even more prevalent for people in this day and age. I’ve studied IT already this year, which I’ve stated above. I came to RMIT because I have a full-time job and the convenience of being able to study single subjects online was ideal for me to try and slowly but surely get through all the subjects to hopefully finish and get a degree so I can earn more money in the long run. I expect to get a well-rounded knowledge of all aspects of the subject and find a specific field in the industry that may interest me more than others to pursue.</p>

<h1>Ideal Job:</h1>

<div class="sectionContent">
<article>
<p>This was the career I had in mind when I first started studying IT, I understand its along way off from what I’ve studied so far but this is what sparked my initial drive to get started. This position was appealing to me because of the amount of industry all moving online and it’s going to be a career that not a lot of people know too much about because of how ever changing it is which is what I like about it. The field of cyber security is quite extensive in the amount of knowledge you must acquire before you can even be considered as an applicant. A Degree in information technology is only the beginning of a long educational journey to gather all the skills needed for this position. Knowledge in multiple operating systems, experience in all different aspects of IT especially networking, common techniques used to make intrusions into systems. My experience is not anywhere near that, but this is my goal to achieve in the future. My skills now would be more along the lines of a help desk/support role. My plan is to do this degree as I work in the IT field and gather skills in a work environment and get paid will I try and complete my studies in my own time to get the degree. </p>

<h1>Opinion:</h1>
<p>These test’s are all a bit ridiculous in my opinion I think there a bit like horoscopes for your personality in a way. They’re not going to have too much influence on anything I do. I guess I can see the benefit from a business perspective as a generalisation of someone if they’re applying for a job and the employer wants an easy way of judging character before they meet them in person.</p>

<h1>Project Idea:</h1>
</div>
<div class="sectionContent">
<article>
<h1>Overview/Motivation:</h1>
<p>My project idea stems from using online betting services in Australia. According to Statista, the global market size of the sports betting industry is $203 Billion. The sports betting industry employs 197 thousand people worldwide and there are more than 31 thousand sports betting businesses currently operating all around the world. These services all provide different odds on many different sports and a lot of the time when you place a bet that wins there might be another service that was providing better odds. There are websites that create a GUI and link people to allocated sites but what I wanted to do was create an updating database that could collect the information on the odds from multiple sites when the odds are released and provide the user with a GUI that would show them the best odds-on sports that were looking for. There’s a very large market for this in Australia, you see it marketed towards everyday people constantly and there’s no way of knowing which the best service is to use</p>
</article>

<article>
<h1>Description:</h1>
<p>This idea would stem from building a website at first providing information on sport, like articles and information to upcoming sporting events etc. And then having odds of all the main sports that most people are likely to be betting on and showing them the best application services to use when doing so to gain the most profit. The main aspect of the website would be to provide the information on where to find the best odds. Most services only direct the user to the website and they have to spend a lot of their own time searching through all the sites individually and sign up to view these things this would take out all the time searching through all of this data to give the user what there looking at betting on with best price. Some of the features of the service would be providing the viewer information on future events, podcast links of sporting channels, videos that would be interesting towards that market. This would provide internet traffic there even for people that didn’t necessarily want to gamble they can still come and do their own research on sport in general. Eventually once members have been made you could start a mailing service on updates to all this information. An app service for mobile users would also be necessary as most people would be viewing this on their desired device and what is most convenient to the user.</p>

<article>
<h1>Tools & Technologies:</h1>
<p>Website design software would be essential with this project to create a nice GUI for the user to navigate easily as that is the whole point of the website to cut down the time it takes for the user to make their decisions. The website can be made using GitHub after the HTML and CSS has been made. The hardest part of this project would be to gather all the data from the betting services in an appropriate time frame so that it is beneficial for the user to be using this service. The best option I can see to do this would be to scrape data from all the websites needed to write into an updating database on excel so that you can also provide the user with averages from each site so that there’s also options to make a judgement that way. Also turning that information into HTML for the website and application for mobiles.</p>
</article>

<article>
<h1>Skills Required:</h1>
<p>This would be quite extensive time wise in my opinion to do as there would be a lot of updating of information required to continue the operation. Scraping the data could be done by bots, but an engineer’s expertise would be most important to take all of that information and create something readable and easy to be accessible by someone in the general public. A knowledge of how to use website design software, HTML and CSS would be greatly beneficial in this project. Building the website and app would take a lot of work like graphic design, knowing how to create large databases, knowing marketing and how to make it appealing to your market audience.</p>
</article>

<article>
<h1>Outcome:</h1>
<p>If this project was successful, the user would be provided with a lot of information dedicated to what their interested in. A lot of time would be saved by the user and all the information would be in one spot as not to cause frustration for the user when looking or searching for the best options. They would also have the option of entertainment from providing articles, podcasts, videos, images on things that the market of people would be generally interested in.</p>
